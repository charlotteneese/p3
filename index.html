        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <h4>Work</h4>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer. I have a background in recruiting and administrative work. All which invloved computers and online interaction. That is what peaked my interest in being able to create the very websites I use in my daily life. I want to creat ones that are easy to use and understand. I would like to be the one behind that. </p>
        <h4>Personal</h4>
        <p>My husband and I just bought our first house. Our little hamster loves running around with all this room. My husband being a linux systems engineer has been very supportive in my goals of getting off the phone in a work environment and moving into a computer based career.</p>

        <p>My plan is to become a proficent front end developer in 6 months.</p>
       
        <p>I’d like to do free lance work so I not only can work on my schedule and time, but can choose the great projects I start on. I want those I work with to have an amazing experience and love what I create for them.</p>
        <p>To accomplish my goals, I am learning the following:</p>
